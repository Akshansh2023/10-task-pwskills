    "Getter and setter are two methods used in object-oriented programming to access and modify the values of attributes or variables in a class. In Python, getter and setter methods can be defined using the @property and @<attribute>.setter decorators, respectively. A getter method is used to retrieve the value of an attribute or variable, while a setter method is used to set the value of an attribute or variable in a class. Using getter and setter methods, we can control access to the attributes of a class and apply validation or data manipulation before setting or getting their values. In short, getter and setter methods provide an interface to access and modify the attributes of a class in a controlled manner.\n",
